## Overview

SlowCraft is a powerful tool that leverages RIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Frame Estimation) to create stunning slow-motion videos. Built with Python and Tkinter, this desktop application enhances your video editing experience by providing smooth frame interpolation. Whether you are a content creator, filmmaker, or just someone who enjoys making videos, SlowCraft is designed to meet your needs.

## Features

- **Frame Interpolation**: Utilize RIFE for smooth slow-motion effects.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive Tkinter GUI.
- **Video Processing**: Supports various video formats using FFmpeg.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and modify as per your requirements.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

To get started with SlowCraft, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/G11br/SlowCraft/releases). You will find the necessary files there. After downloading, follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed. Use the following command to install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the extracted folder and execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Using SlowCraft is straightforward. Follow these steps to create your slow-motion video:

1. **Open the Application**: Launch SlowCraft from your desktop.
2. **Select Video**: Click on the "Open Video" button to choose your video file.
3. **Set Parameters**: Adjust the interpolation settings as needed.
4. **Process Video**: Click on the "Generate SlowMo" button to start processing.
5. **Save the Output**: Once done, save your new slow-motion video to your desired location.

## How It Works

SlowCraft uses advanced algorithms to analyze the frames of your video. By estimating intermediate frames, it creates smooth transitions that enhance the slow-motion effect. The core technology behind this process is RIFE, which is optimized for real-time performance.

### Frame Interpolation

Frame interpolation involves generating new frames between existing ones. RIFE uses deep learning techniques to predict these frames, resulting in high-quality slow-motion effects. This method is particularly effective for fast-moving subjects, ensuring that motion blur is minimized.

### Video Processing with FFmpeg

SlowCraft utilizes FFmpeg, a powerful multimedia framework, to handle video files. This allows for support of a wide range of formats and codecs. The integration ensures that your video processing is efficient and reliable.
